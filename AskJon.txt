do ids fix themselves ever ? like when something is deleted are the ids re-ceralized  ?

help with seed script, 
   - it kinda works, 
   - when i run a migrate dev, should the seed be firing off
   -  cannot execute ts-node commands 
   -  when i run 'npx prisma seed db' i get foreign key restrictions and cannot delete
